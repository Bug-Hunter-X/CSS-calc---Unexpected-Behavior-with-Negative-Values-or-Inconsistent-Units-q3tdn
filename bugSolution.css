To avoid this issue, ensure the calculation within `calc()` always results in a non-negative value for properties like `width` and `height`.  Also, maintain consistent units throughout the calculation (e.g., all `px`, all `em`, etc.).  If you need to mix units, ensure you correctly convert them.  Consider using `max()` or `min()` to clamp values to avoid negative results.  For example, instead of directly using a calculation that might produce a negative value, use `max(0, calculation)` to ensure that the final value is always at least 0.
