The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, if the calculation results in a negative value for a property that cannot be negative (like `width` or `height`), it might lead to unexpected results.  The element might collapse or render incorrectly.  Additionally, units must be consistent within the calculation; mixing `px` and `em` without proper conversion might cause issues.
